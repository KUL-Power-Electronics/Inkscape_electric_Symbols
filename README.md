# Overview

# Using the library
* Open Inkscape_Symbols_xxx and copy the symbols of interrest to your incscape sheet
* Recommended way to move objects: drag them next to a endpoint (it makes a difference where you touch the component), to make shure to work on the grid
* Recommended way to modify wires: Mark line (F1-key for mark-tool), press F2-key, click on the end of the line so that the fixed point becomes red, now you can move this point.     
* Recommended way to rotate the component: click 2 times on the component until the turning arrows are visible. Turn the component while keeping the ctrl key pressed.     
* Recommended way to mirrow components: Press v (vertical) or h (horizontal)
* Grid on/off by #-key
* Change Color of area: Mark area, click on Color
* Change Color of line: Mark line, shift + click on Color
* Note: Some components consist of areas and lines (e.g. arrow). When changing color, both actions must be performed. Due to a program bug, sometimes the change becomes effective after opening the formating editor (Ctrl + shift + F)
